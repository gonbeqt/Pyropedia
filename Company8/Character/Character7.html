                <h2>Tamaki Kotatsu</h2>
                <p>Tamaki Kotatsu in "Fire Force" undergoes a significant transformation from a timid rookie to a confident and skilled firefighter. Initially struggling with insecurity and her "Lucky Lecher Lure," she grows through training and missions, finding her purpose and earning respect from her team. Sporting a distinctive appearance, both on and off duty, she showcases resilience and strength as she faces challenges and bonds with her teammates, ultimately becoming a key player in the 8th Special Fire Brigade. Additionally, her Ignition Ability grants her cat-like characteristics, adding complexity to her character development.</p>

                <h2>Abilities: Third Generation (Pyrokinetic)</h2>
                <p>Tamaki, first underestimated in Company 1, has latent qualities that she subsequently exploits, demonstrating rapid crisis management and adaptability. As a Third Generation pyrokinetic, her Ignition Ability protects her from burns and engulfs her in pink flames, giving her cat-like characteristics and increasing agility and movement. She can push herself with her tails, unleash powerful fire blasts, and evolve to coat her body in flames, increasing flexibility and allowing her to destroy big fire structures. She has improved speed and resilience, allowing her to dodge assaults and endure hits from powerful opponents.</p>
