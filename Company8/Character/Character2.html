                <h2>Hinawa Takehisa</h2>
                <p>Takehisa Hinawa is a young man with short brown hair, bangs covering his brown eyes, and glasses. He wears bunker gear, featuring a dark tank top, trousers, and a protective jacket with cross-shaped buttons and blue-lined accents, along with a neck protector, gloves, and dark boots. On the battlefield, he carries various artillery. Off duty, he opts for an orange jumpsuit, dark shoes, and a headgear with changing designs. His attire bears "8" patches, signifying his affiliation with the 8th Special Fire Brigade.

                <p>Hinawa, a Second Generation, fights fires with weaponry such as submachine guns or handguns. His ability, "Bullet Speed Control," allows him to control bullet impact power by regulating propellant ignition. With "Trajectory Control," he adjusts bullet trajectory by shooting from different angles and distances, leaving a trail of fire. "Ricochet Control" allows him to rebound bullets off surfaces, increasing velocity. He also employs Special Fire Extinguishing Bullets to defeat and slow down Infernals.</p>
