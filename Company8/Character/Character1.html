                <h2>Akitaru Obi</h2>
                <p>Akitaru Obi, a well-built young man with short, slightly messy dark hair, shaved sides, and small dark brown eyes, wears bunker gear on the battlefield. His outfit consists of a black tank top, slacks, and a protective jacket with blue-lined decorations, which is accompanied by a jumper, neck protector, gloves, and black boots. Obi wields a variety of weapons and wears "8" patches to indicate his allegiance with the 8th Special Fire Brigade. Off duty, he wears a grey jumpsuit. Throughout "Fire Force," Obi's path takes him from a determined leader to a resilient captain, managing personal problems while instilling trust, teamwork, and a strong sense of justice in his unit.</p>

                <h2>Abilities: Non-Powered Human</h2>
                <p>Akitaru's firefighting commendations were removed because he prioritized residents' lives over commands. His knowledge allows him to appraise circumstances and reassure allies. Despite lacking ignition skills, he maintains a healthy physique and can carry up to 30kg of equipment on missions. Captain Giovanni admires his incredible power, as evidenced by his efficient use of many weapons in battle. Akitaru strikes without hesitation, risking his life to generate opportunities or carry out plans. He devises plans on the spot, employing unique techniques such as train tracks as ladders and fire extinguisher foam as smokescreens. He's willing to take heavy damage to close up on formidable adversaries, even allowing himself to be struck by Benimaru explosions.</p>
