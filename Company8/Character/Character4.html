                <h2>Shinra Kusakabe</h2>
                <p>Shinra Kusakabe, originally depicted as a slender youngster with short spiky black hair and crimson eyes, wears bunker gear bearing the number 8, indicating his brigade membership. Maki Oze altered his trousers to stop below the knees, preventing damage from his Ignition Ability. Off duty, he wears an orange coverall with patches reading "Company 8." In disguise, he has white hair, flame-style earrings, and tattoos resembling Adolla. He then reverts to black hair and takes off his earrings. Through soul resonance, he transforms into Shinrabanshō-man, with demonic looks and flame tattoos, similar to Hibachi Shinmon's doppelgänger. Throughout "Fire Force," Shinra grows from a confused rookie firefighter burdened by his "devil" reputation to a mature and responsible hero. He accepts the past and  embraces his role in protecting society, forms deep bonds with his teammates, seeks truth about spontaneous human combustion, and strengthens his abilities through adversity.</p>

                <h2>Abilities: Third and Fourth Generation (Pyrokinetic)</h2>
                <p>Shinra is one of the strongest characters in Fire Force, with great combat abilities. Despite being a novice, he faced veteran members and even defeated a Captain. His past as a Fire Soldier gives him the strength to save countless individuals from dangerous circumstances. Shinra effectively uses his Ignition Ability and hand-to-hand skills in combat, executing surprising break dancing-inspired maneuvers. He has incredible toughness, withstanding harsh beatings and extreme heat. He also has improved vision and an unbreakable resolve, which is motivated by his heroic goals and devotion to his family. Despite losing his pyrokinetic talents, he obtains immense physical and magical powers, establishing his place as one of the series' most powerful characters.</p>
