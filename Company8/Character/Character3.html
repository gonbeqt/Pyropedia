                <h2>Maki Oze</h2>
                <p>Maki Oze, a thin and voluptuous young woman with wide violet eyes and long dark hair, is easily identifiable in her bunker suit emblazoned with "8" patches, denoting her participation in Special Fire Force Company 8. She wears a sleeveless top and black trousers, as well as a protective jacket and trousers with distinguishing blue lines. A neck protector, gloves, boots, and helmet round out her costume. For formal events, she wears a black jacket and skirt with a white belt, paired with black shoes carrying the "8" logo. Maki prefers shirts and pants for his civilian wear. Throughout the series, she goes through a remarkable metamorphosis from a reluctant Second Generation pyrokinetic burdened by family expectations to a confident leader among her squad, overcoming anxieties and forging powerful relationships with her comrades, reconciling with her family's legacy, and embodying strength and resolve in challenging situations.</p>

                <h2>Abilities: Second Generation (Pyrokinetic)</h2>
                <p>Maki is a skilled fighter that Takehisa refers to as a witch. She excels at hand-to-hand combat and can easily disarm opponents like Arthur. Even the most powerful members of the Fire Force admire her adaptability. Maki, a former soldier in the Tokyo Military, has extensive expertise dealing with several opponents and easily overcoming greater rivals. She's also an accomplished instructor, teaching Shinra effective grappling tactics. Maki's small form conceals deceiving raw strength, allowing her to effortlessly move large metal pipes.</p>
