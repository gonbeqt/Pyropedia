She organizes the Second Cataclysm and gathers disciples such as Faerie and Dragon for the promised day. The Evangelist is knowledgeable about spontaneous human combustion, Adolla Burst, and the Adolla world. She kidnaps children for research, which results in the acquisition of Haumea as the Second Pillar. She appears in pivotal moments, causing Mari Kusakabe to be blinded and influencing Shō Kusakabe's destiny..</p>
