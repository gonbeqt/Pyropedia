                <h2>Charon</h2>
                <p>Charon is a tall, muscular man with light-colored hair who is frequently seen wearing a blindfold with a red cross. His outfit resembles a martial arts costume, with dark gloves, a belt displaying the same cross insignia, and a toeless Tabi. He is committed to the Evangelist and has been Haumea's guardian since she was a youngster. Despite his annoyance and irritation with Haumea's aggressive manner, Charon is crafty and confident in fight, frequently simulating Third Generation Ignition Ability. His absolute love for Haumea motivates him to support the White-Clad's cause, thinking that the Evangelist would put an end to her suffering. Twelve years ago, he assisted Haumea in abducting the Third Pillar, Shō Kusakabe, demonstrating his commitment to the goal.</p>

                <h2>Abilities: Second Generation (Pyrokinetic) </h2>
                <p>Charon excelled at hand-to-hand combat, delivering strong attacks and grabs thanks to his great strength and resilient build. His body could resist severe injury and heal swiftly. Charon's Second Generation talent allowed him to absorb kinetic energy from assaults and turn it into thermal energy, resulting in massive explosions. With minor gestures, he could re-direct this energy and produce many forms of explosions. However, he was unable to absorb and release energy at the same time, making him vulnerable to attacks. There was a limit to how much energy he could absorb; deflecting a nuclear explosion from Nataku drained him, while receiving repeated blasts from Hinawa killed him. Despite this, Charon shown amazing competence against formidable pyrokinetic fighters like as Kurono and Shinmon, earning the latter's respect as a "monster."</p>
