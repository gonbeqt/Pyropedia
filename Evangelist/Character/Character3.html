                <h2>Haumea</h2>
                <p> Haumea is a young woman with long pale-blonde hair put in a bun and a golden crown-like helmet that hides her facial characteristics. She's wearing a loose white onesie with dark cloth underneath and white footwear. Her gown bears the image of a red sun. Initially quiet, she develops a humorous and wicked attitude, motivated by hearing humanity's deepest thoughts. Despite her brutality, she has sympathy for Charon, who has shown her unconditional love. Haumea has been with the Evangelist for most of her life and was charged with abducting Shō Kusakabe, the Third Pillar, at the age of five. Her Adolla Burst activation caused mental strain, which triggered her cruel tendencies as a coping mechanism.</p>

                <h2>Abilities: Third Generation (Pyrokinetic) </h2>
                <p>Haumea, a Third Generation Pyrokinetic, uses Electric Shock to manipulate electrical signals in order to control nerves and behaviors, communicate remotely, and read thoughts. She has the ability to control Demon Infernals and view occurrences that ordinary people cannot see. Haumea obtained extra powers as a result of other Pillars' sacrifices, such as immunity to harm during stopped time, precognition, and the capacity to launch a deadly light attack. However, her skills are ineffectual against plasma-based abilities like Arthur's.</p>
