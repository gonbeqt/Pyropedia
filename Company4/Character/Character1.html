His journey entails overcoming stereotypes, finding redemption, and eventually emerging as a successful leader within his team, all while developing relationships and facing his history.</p>

                <p>Despite his lack of pyrokinetic talents, Hague was a skilled warrior who knew how to use firefighting tools successfully in warfare. He could quickly restrain targets with safety lines and use fire axes with devastating precision. Despite his age, he displayed quickness and durability, easily dealing with powerful opponents and withstanding strikes from Shinra and Gold until his limitations were reached.</p>
