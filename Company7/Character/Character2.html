                <h2>Konro Sagamiya</h2>
                <p>Konro Sagamiya, a tall man with black hair pulled back in a ponytail and a scar between his nose and eyes, wears a gray or black kimono. Tephrosis scars on his shoulders, as well as charred skin and bandaged arms, indicate his tragic history. Initially serving as a mentor figure in "Fire Force," Konro overcomes physical constraints and fears with the help of his friend Benimaru and tutelage from Shinra. His journey is distinguished by bravery and selflessness in the face of peril, which has led to his status as a recognized hero inside Company 7.</p>

                <h2>Abilities: Third Generation (Pyrokinetic)</h2>
                <p>Konro's Third Generation ability energizes his shoulders and forearms, increasing his punching power. Even without it, he could destroy an Infernal's core via raw force. Overusing his Ignition Ability resulted in Tephrosis, making him unable to fight. His abilities force him to fall quickly after activation, particularly if he has not fully healed. In his prime, his firepower rivaled Benimaru's Crimson Moon technique, which he inspired. He could make gigantic holes, which usually required enormous destructive energy, such as when killing a Demon Infernal. </p>
