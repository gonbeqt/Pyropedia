                <h2>Benima Shinmon</h2>
                <p>Benimaru Shinmon is a young man with a light complexion, neck-length wavy black hair framing his face, and startling red eyes—one with a black dot pupil and the other with a white X-shaped pupil. Benimaru is first shown as a reclusive and skeptical leader in the Special Fire Force, but he develops significantly throughout the series. His backstory is slowly revealed, shedding light on his protective impulses for the inhabitants of Asakusa. Over time, he discovers the importance of teamwork, trust, and emotional connection, evolving into a more open-minded and adaptive leader who relies on others, demonstrating his personal and professional development. He usually wears a white t-shirt with a black vest, a gray kimono upper-garment over his left arm, and Special Fire Force uniform trousers tucked into black boots, and previously wore black fingerless gloves and a sweater tied around his waist.</p>

He teaches Shinra and Arthur, unlocking their abilities, especially Hysterical Strength. Benimaru excels at hand-to-hand combat, having mastered iaido martial arts. He is extremely fast, strong, and durable, with an incredible resistance to poison.</p>
